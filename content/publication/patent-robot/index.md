abstract: The laboratory equipment for in-situ testing and sampling at the soil-water interface features a Cartesian robot with four-axis motion capabilities (three degrees of freedom), designated for the area of environmental sciences. The Cartesian robot is equipped with a quick-release tool adapter that can be fitted with various tools, including a coordinate measuring robot, an online gas flux measurement tool, an in-situ microelectrode measurement tool, a high-resolution liquid handling tool, and a soil sampling tool. These tools allow for real-time monitoring of gas exchange at the soil-water interface, tracking changes in physical and chemical parameters at the interface, collecting overlying water samples, and in-situ soil sampling.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The Cartesian robot with a quick-release tool adapter enables real-time monitoring and sampling at the soil-water interface for comprehensive analysis in the mesocosm studies.
