abstract: Studies on microbial communities associated with foliage in natural ecosystems have
grown in number in recent years yet have rarely focused on urban ecosystems. With urbanization,
phyllosphere microorganisms in the urban environment have come under pressures from increasing
human activities. To explore the effects of urbanization on the phyllosphere microbial communities of
urban ecosystems, we investigated the phyllosphere microbial structure and the diversity of camphor
trees in eight parks along a suburban-to-urban gradient. The results showed that the number of
ASVs (amplicon sequence variants), unique on the phyllosphere microbial communities of three
different urbanization gradients, was 4.54 to 17.99 times higher than that of the shared ASVs. Specific
microbial biomarkers were also found for leaf samples from each urbanization gradient. Moreover,
significant differences (R^2 = 0.133, p = 0.005) were observed in the phyllosphere microbial structure
among the three urbanization gradients. Alpha diversity and co-occurrence patterns of bacterial
communities showed that urbanization can strongly reduce the complexity and species richness
of the phyllosphere microbial network of camphor trees. Correlation analysis with environmental
factors showed that leaf total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S), as well as leaf C/N, soil pH, and
artificial light intensity at night (ALIAN) were the important drivers in determining the divergence
of phyllosphere microbial communities across the urbanization gradient. Together, we found that
urbanization can affect the composition of the phyllosphere bacterial community of camphor trees,
and that the interplay between human activities and plant microbial communities may contribute to
shaping the urban microbiome.
